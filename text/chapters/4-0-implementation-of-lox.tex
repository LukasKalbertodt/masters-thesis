This chapter discusses the major design decisions and notable implementation details behind \code{lox}.
In the end, a short overview over all features offered by the library is presented.
As already mentioned in the introduction, \code{lox} is licensed as MIT/Apache-2.0 and is developed here: \url{https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/lox}.

The library consists of a single crate (one minor exception is explained later) which is very common for medium-sized Rust libraries.
As \code{lox} contains a variety of features, it is likely that some users do not need all of them.
To avoid compiling parts of the library that are unused, \code{lox} uses \emph{Cargo features} to let the user disable those parts individually.
For example, if a user does not read from or write to files, the IO module can be disabled completely and thus will not be compiled or linked.

To maintain a high code quality, various automated tests and checks are used.
These are further explained in the respective sections of this chapter.
All of these tests are automatically executed on a \emph{continuous integration} (CI) server whenever commits are pushed to the repository or a \emph{pull request} is created.
The CI also builds the documentation and makes sure that no compiler warnings are emitted.

    As an aside:
    the term \enquote{lox} is often used as an abbreviation for \emph{\textbf{l}iquid \textbf{ox}ygen}, a pale-blue liquid usually obtained by cooling elemental oxygen below its boiling point of 90.188\,K.
    This substance is used in many areas, playing a particularly important role in the aerospace industry where it is commonly used as a cryogenic oxidizer in rockets.
    Since rust (the chemical compound\footnotemark) is a product of an oxidation reaction and rockets are usually fast, using \enquote{lox} as name for this library seemed fitting.
    However, the name was mainly chosen because it is short and pronounceable.
