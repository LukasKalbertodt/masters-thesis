\chapter{Introduction}

This is a test of several formatting options. I want to be done with most of the LaTeX stuff as soon as possible. For one, I want inline code boxes which have different background color and a small round border. For example, I develop the library \code{lox} and it uses a bunch of \code{Vec<T>}. Sometimes, I say stuff like \code{v.adjacent_faces()} in my code.

However, sometimes, a bigger box is needed. For some nice multi line Rust code:

\begin{rustcode}
fn main() {
    let x = 27; // peter
    x == 3;
    for i in 1 .. x + 1 {
        if x % i == 0 {
            println!("Teiler {}!", i);
        }
    }
    Some(3)
}

use std;
mod uhg {}

#[derive(Banana)]
const FOO: usize = 3;
struct Foo<T>(T);
enum Bar {}
\end{rustcode}

And here some C++ code:

\begin{cppcode}
int main() {
printf("hello, world");
return 0;
}
\end{cppcode}

This is after the code.
