\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Marcel Campen and Prof.\ Dr.\ Elke Pulvermüller for supervising this rather atypical topic.

I am truly grateful for my friends Elisa Brauße, Julian Kniephoff, Johan von Behren and various others for their support and all the insightful discussions!
I also want to thank the lovely Rust community for always being helpful and supportive.
My parents Andrea and Seven Kalbertodt have my gratitude for giving me the opportunity to pursue my interest in computer science and for encouraging me to be curious.

I am very lucky to be born into such a fortunate situation and to be surrounded by all these wonderful people.
Without them, this thesis would not have been possible.
